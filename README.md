## üì¶ Overview

`CentroidStructure.hpp` defines the **Mahadevi Centroid** model‚Äîa symbolic vector aggregation construct for AI-based harmonic balance, entropy inspection, and token stream analysis under the TGDK OliviaAI framework.

This structure is used to:
- Aggregate `MahadeviVector` instances into logical sectors
- Compute positional centroid, harmonic balance, and entropy
- Provide symbolic invariants for AI cognition and feedback systems
- Serve as a dynamic memory cell for high-fidelity geometric AI learning

## üìê Core Structure

```cpp
centroid Mahadevi {
    std::vector<MahadeviSector> sectors;
    Vector3f position;
    float radialVariance;
    float harmonicBalance;
    float entropy;
    size_t tokenCount;

    void Add(const MahadeviVector& mv);
    float ComputeRadialVariance() const;
    void Print(const std::string& label) const;
};
```

Each MahadeviSector is constructed from a MahadeviVector and holds:

Position in 3D space

Symbolic symmetry score

Entropy scalar

Token stream for logic sequencing

## üß© Integration
Include it in any pipeline:

```cpp
Copy
Edit
#include "CentroidStructure.hpp"

TGDK::Mahadevi phiCore;

MahadeviVector mv;
mv.base = { 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f };
mv.symmetry = 0.87f;
mv.entropy = 0.44f;
mv.tokens = {101, 202, 303};

phiCore.Add(mv);
phiCore.Print("Phi Core Analysis");
```

## 3. CLAUSELINE PROTECTION

The TGDK ClauseLine ensures:

- All derivatives carry a symbolic fingerprint from the original system.
- Unauthorized forks or erasures trigger **Clause Deflection**, nullifying trust metrics in all OliviaAI instances.
- Derivative systems using TGDK broadcast logic without registry will be blacklisted from the TGDK Sovereign Vault.
